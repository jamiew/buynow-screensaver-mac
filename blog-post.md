This is a recreation of the famous BeOS "BUY NOW" screensaver for macOS. It has a dark blue background and white text.

Original screensaver by [Ficus Kirkpatrick](http://toastycode.com/besavers/)

[Available on GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/buy-now).

Shoutout to [Toastycode](http://toastycode.com/besavers/buynow.html) who made a Mac version of this previously.

In 1995 BeOS shipped with pervasive multithreading, symmetric multiprocessing, and a 64-bit filesystem. It was way ahead of its time and maybe too beautiful to survive <3
